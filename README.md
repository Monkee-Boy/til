# Today I Learned

Inspired by [thoughtbot/til](https://github.com/thoughtbot/til), this repo is to share small snippets and things we learn on weekly basis. These will be Markdown files with a quick description and sample code on a new concept, command, tip, browser quirk, or anything else we have learned worth mentioning.
